Can think of Object-Oriented Programming like A PIE:


Abstraction - only show what's necessary to the user of the object
i.e. hide away the implementation details inside something

User wants to push a button and the programming to "just work". They don't care about the
back-end code which makes it work.

Inheritance - Encourages code reusability by letting one object acquire the properties
and methods of another object.

Super class / parent class / base class <- subclass / extended class / child class


Polymorphism

poly = many, morph = forms
Polymorphism - the ability of a class to run a method in 2 or more different ways


Encapsulation - data hiding - where we restrict access to certain properties or methods of an object
                                to whatever is calling the object.

OOP - programming based around the concept of objects

Object - contains data in the form of properties and functions (or attributes and methods).

E.g. Car is an object.
Red colour, four wheels, etc. are properties.
Drive, reverse, turn, etc. are methods.
